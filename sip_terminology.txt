SIP Terminology

Messages
	individual "text bodies" between servers and clients

Transactions
	All messages from first request to final response
	(say, INVITE, RINGING, OK)
	Does not include ACK

Dialogue
	A persistent peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two UA's.
	Everything from the INVITE to the final BYE/OK transaction.
	This is identified by a Call-ID, but is not a "Call" because a call can include multiple callees, each with their own dialogue with the caller.
	Also called a call-leg.

Call
	All dialogues of a callee, i.e., could be a conference call.
