SIP Registration

Each client sends a REGISTER message that informs the server of its present location.
The Registrar stores this binding (user/address) in a location server.
Proxies use this location server.

Contact <sip:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx>
Expires: 3600

	SIP Registrar -> Location Server

	SIP Registrar -> End User
